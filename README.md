# MasterProject
ECG Classification

## Overview

This project is going to classifiy 6-class Arrhythmia using SVM, Xgboost, CNN, LSTM. 

## Install

If you don't have wfdbï¼Œinstall it with

```
pip install wfdb
```

This is a package which is used for processing MIT-BIH database. 

If you don't have `Biosppy 0.6.1`, install it with 

```
pip install biosppy
```

which is a package for ECG signal processing. 

You can setup the environment using setup.sh

Make sure that the environment is `python 3.7`

## Dataset

You need to download the MIT-BIH dataset from [Physionet](https://storage.googleapis.com/mitdb-1.0.0.physionet.org/mit-bih-arrhythmia-database-1.0.0.zip). Unzip and rename the folder is mitbd. Put the folder in Data. 

Download the Data, which is segment by an 1800 length of the sliding window, and the interval is 100.  [Google Drvie](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uce2k-iDb8Kd1tAYrvQlX7Hd1hsU-xno/view?usp=sharing) Put the file in the folder which is named as Data. 

## Details

There are 5 index you can choose when you run `main.py`. 

### Preprocessing

* You can put the number 0 to run the Preprocessing function. 
* You will get the Heart Beats dataset for training and testing.
